# ezmojis
Emoji Selector.

rofi-emoji is great but bloated and not easy to configure: just work on rofi and the database manage is not friendly.
Ezmojis can find and copy (clipboard or primary selection) emojis and devicons in rofi, dmenu and fzf.
The database is just a text file.

## Dependencies
Obviusly a font with emoji support and devicons or glyphs.
I use : [Mononoki Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), and Noto Color Emoji

You can choose the menu selector: dmenu, rofi or fzf.


## Instalation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andyrufasto/ezmojis.git
cd ezmojis
install
```
## Usage:
![Preview](ezmojis.gif)

# Customization:

The database is just a text file in `$HOME/.local/share/ezmojis/`
You can add anoter file `my_glyphs.txt` inside and run (i.e): `ezmojis my_glyphs -r`

Modify the options of rofi or dmenu on the script in `$HOME/.local/bin/ezmojis`
